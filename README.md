   - Conducted **in-depth EDA** and **visualizations**.

2. **Classification Models (Credit Score Dataset)**  
   - **Logistic Regression**  
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - **Decision Tree**  
   - Conducted **detailed comparisons** of these models.  
   - Analyzed **feature importance** and evaluated **performance metrics**.  
   - Included **extensive visualizations** and **data preprocessing**.

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning  
1. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - **Dataset:** Customer Credit Data  
   - Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on financial behavior.  

2. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering**  
   - **Dataset:** People's Height and Weight  
   - Used GMM to identify distinct groups within the dataset.  

3. **K-Means from Scratch**  
   - Implemented the **K-Means algorithm manually** to understand its working mechanism.  

4. **GMM from Scratch**  
   - Built a **Gaussian Mixture Model from scratch** to explore probabilistic clustering.
